    <h1>Lyrics to Three is the magic number (first verse)</h1>
    <p>[Intro: Bob Dorough]</p>
  <p>Three is a magic number</p>
  <p>Yes, it is, its a magic number</p>

  <p>[Verse: Bob Dorough]</p>
  <p>Somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity</p>
  <p>You get three as a magic number</p>
  <p>The past and the present and the future</p>
  <p>The faith and hope and charity</p>
  <p>The heart and the brain and the body</p>
  <p>Give you three as a magic number</p>
  <p>It takes three legs to make a tripod or to make a table stand</p>
  <p>And it takes three wheels to make a vehicle called a tricycle</p>
  <p>Every triangle has three corners, every triangle has three sides</p>
  <p>No more, no less, you don't have to guess</p>
  <p>When it's three, you can see</p>
  <p>It's a magic number</p>
